  <h1>Company Website</h1>
  <div class="container">
    <p>My idea for a website was for a company that my friend and I would
	   run. This company would program mobile apps mainly for the 
	   android. I looked up other similar companies' websites in order to
	   understand what should be on my website. Most of the sites I looked
	   at had a simple and similar structure. My site architecture is
	   below.</p>

	<h3>Summary of Other Opinions</h3>
	<p>Since there aren't many categories, the opinions of the people I
	   asked didn't differ by much. Three of the people didn't have Support
	   under the Game category. Two moved Report Bugs to the Game category.</p>
