		    <p>In Peer-to-Peer networking, peers request service from and 
			   provide service to other peers instead of communicating with 
			   a server. To show this, I have someone giving a package to 
			   someone else.</p>

		    <p>Once you log into a website, it can use a cookie 
			   as a certificate as a form of identification. This is why
			   on sites like facebook, you don't have to log in everytime
			   you close your browser. To show this, I drew a simple ID
			   card.</p>

		  <td>
		    <p>Normally when you go to a website, your browser sends a 
			   request to a server which sends a response back. Some servers
			   can be pretty distant and could be slower. To reduce delay,
			   a web cache can be installed. A web cache checks to see if
			   it has the website you requested stored. If not or its stored
			   website is out of date, it will send your request to the
			   server and then send the response to you. I thought of the
			   situation when you go to the store and they don't have
			   something you want. So, they order it from a warehouse.</p>
